# run_once
Python script for limiting to one running of the same script instance.  
Inspired by [Socket-Singleton](https://pypi.org/project/Socket-Singleton/)

The main idea is to provide a way to detect if program is already running (and close it if so),  
by using socket port binding (if port is used, itâ€™s means another instance is already running).

The main purpose of this version is to auto chose a port.

# Algorithm for chose a dedicated port
I chose to implement a checksum based on the program name given by :
```python
    import sys
    name = sys.argv[0]
```
I chose the Alder checksum over basic checksum cause in basic checksum letters order do not change the result.
Futher more Alder give a 32bits checksum, i use it to bind 2 ports and reduce colisions chances.
